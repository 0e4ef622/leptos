# Leptos in a GTK App

This example creates a basic GTK app that uses Leptosâ€™s reactive primitives.

## Build and Run

Unlike the other examples, this has a variety of build prerequisites that are out of scope of this crate. More detail on that can be found [here](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/book/installation.html). The example comes from [here](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/book/hello_world.html) and should be
runnable with `cargo run` if you have the GTK prerequisites installed.
