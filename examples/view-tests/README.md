# Leptos View Tests

This is a collection of mostly internal view tests for Leptos. Feel free to look if curious to see a variety of ways you can build identical views!

## Client Side Rendering

To run it as a Client Side App, you can issue `trunk serve --open` in the root. This will build the entire
app into one CSR bundle.
