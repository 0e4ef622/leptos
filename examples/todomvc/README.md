# Leptos TodoMVC

This is a Leptos implementation of the TodoMVC example common to many frameworks. This is a relatively-simple application but shows off features like interaction between components and state management.

## Client Side Rendering

To run it as a Client Side App, you can issue `trunk serve --open` in the root. This will build the entire
app into one CSR bundle.
